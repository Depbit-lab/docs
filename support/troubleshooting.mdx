> Follow the sections in order — many issues are resolved after completing the previous steps.

## Before You Begin

1. Ensure the device is receiving stable power through the USB-C connection.  
2. Confirm that you are using the **original factory firmware** (updates are rarely needed).  
3. Note any on-screen error messages and recent configuration changes.  
4. If possible, back up your credentials via the **local web manager** before making changes.

## Quick Symptom & Solution Table

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device does not power on | USB cable or port not supplying power | Try a different USB-C cable or port; avoid USB hubs; connect directly to a PC or power bank |
| OLED screen stays blank | Display initialization delay or EEPROM not responding | Wait 5 seconds after connection; if persistent, reconnect or check solder joints on the EEPROM |
| Touch buttons unresponsive | TS06 controller not detected or miscalibrated | Clean the golden pads and reconnect; if still unresponsive, perform a factory reset |
| `EEPROM ERROR` or `IV MISSING` on screen | Memory communication or data corruption | Power-cycle and retry; if persistent, contact support for inspection |
| Wrong PIN delays access | Exponential lockout triggered after failed attempts | Wait for the countdown to complete and retry with the correct PIN |
| TOTP shows `REQTIME` | Time not synchronized with host | Use the web manager and press **Sync Time** before generating codes |

## Step-by-Step Procedures

### 1. Safe Restart

- Unplug ZeroKeyUSB.  
- Wait about **5 seconds**.  
- Reconnect to a USB power source (PC or phone).  
  The splash screen should appear within 3–5 seconds.

### 2. Reset Touch Controller

1. Disconnect and reconnect the device.  
2. Wait until the **ZeroKeyUSB** logo appears.  
3. Tap each golden pad to confirm all five respond.  
   If touch remains unresponsive, perform a **factory reset** to recalibrate automatically.

### 3. Firmware Flash (development units only)

> ⚠️ Production devices are resin-encapsulated and cannot be reflashed by the user.  
> This section applies **only to pre-production boards**.

1. Quickly reconnect the USB cable twice within one second to enter bootloader mode.  
2. Copy the firmware `.uf2` file to the drive named **ZEROBOOT**.  
3. Wait for the file transfer to complete, then reconnect normally.  
4. Verify the firmware version under **Menu → Settings → About**.

### 4. Factory Reset and Reconfiguration

- Export credentials via the web manager (**Backup → Export**).  
- Hold the **center touch pad** for about 10 seconds until the confirmation countdown appears.  
- The process erases all memory, including credentials, PIN signature, and IV.  
- After restart, re-import your backup or run the first-time setup again.

## Collecting Data for Support

- Connect the device and open the **Serial Monitor** at **115200 bps** to capture log output.  
- Take photos of any on-screen errors.  
- Note the **serial number** (`SN ZK-XXXXXXXX`) and **firmware version** from **Menu → Settings → About**.
