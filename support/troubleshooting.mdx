> Follow the sections in order — many issues are resolved after completing the previous steps.

## Before You Begin

1. Ensure the device is receiving stable power through the USB-C connection.
2. Verify that you are using the latest firmware version.
3. Note down any error messages shown on the OLED screen and recent configuration changes.
4. If possible, back up your credentials via the **web manager** before making changes.

## Quick Symptom & Solution Table

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Recommended Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The device does not power on | USB cable or port not supplying power | Try a different USB-C cable or port; avoid USB hubs; connect directly to a PC or power bank |
| OLED screen stays blank | Display driver not initialized or firmware update interrupted | Reflash the latest firmware; disconnect and reconnect after 30 s |
| Touch buttons unresponsive | TS06 touch controller not detected or miscalibrated | Clean the golden pads, reconnect, and reboot; re-run the setup wizard if needed |
| “EEPROM read fail” or “IV not found” error | Memory communication issue (M24C64-WMN6TP) | Power-cycle the device and retry; if persistent, check solder joints on the EEPROM |
| Wrong PIN delays access | Too many failed attempts triggered the exponential lockout | Wait for the countdown to finish and retry with the correct PIN |
| TOTP shows “Request host time” | Epoch not synced with host | Open the web manager and sync the current time before generating codes |

## Step-by-Step Procedures

### 1. Safe Restart

- Unplug the ZeroKeyUSB.
- Wait 30 seconds.
- Reconnect it to a USB power source (PC or phone).  
  The splash screen should appear within 5 seconds.

### 2. Reset Touch Controller

1. Disconnect and reconnect the device.
2. Wait until the **ZeroKeyUSB** logo appears.
3. Lightly tap each golden pad to verify all five respond.  
   If not, re-enter the **Setup Wizard** from the menu.

### 3. Firmware Update

1. Visit the [Firmware](../firmware/menu.mdx) section to download the latest `.uf2` file.
2. Enter bootloader mode by quickly reconnecting the device twice within one second.
3. Copy the new firmware file to the drive named **ZEROBOOT**.
4. After flashing, reconnect normally and confirm the version in **Menu → Settings → About**.

### 4. Factory Reset and Configuration Restore

- Export credentials via the web interface (`Backup → Export`).
- Hold the **center touch pad** for 10 seconds to perform a full factory reset.
- Re-import your backup or reconfigure manually.

## Collecting Data for Support

- Connect via USB and open the **Serial Monitor** at `9600 baud` to capture log messages.
- Take photos of any on-screen errors.
- Include the **serial number** (`SN ZK-XXXXXXXX`) and **firmware version** from the **About** menu.
