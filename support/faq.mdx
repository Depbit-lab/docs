---

## General

### 🧩 What is ZeroKeyUSB?
ZeroKeyUSB is a **hardware password manager** that stores your credentials completely **offline**.  
It behaves like a regular USB keyboard: when you select a saved account, it simply **types your login details** automatically — no software or internet connection required.

---

### 🔌 Does it need an app or subscription?
No.  
ZeroKeyUSB does not depend on any software, extensions, or subscriptions.  
It works instantly when plugged into any computer, phone, or tablet that accepts a USB keyboard.

---

### 💻 What devices is it compatible with?
ZeroKeyUSB works universally with:
- Windows  
- macOS  
- Linux  
- Android (via USB-C or adapter)  
- iPadOS (USB-C models)

Because it emulates a standard keyboard, it works wherever you can type.

---

### 🔋 Does it have a battery?
No.  
ZeroKeyUSB draws minimal power (around 20 mA) directly from the USB port.  
This makes it **maintenance-free** and ensures your credentials are always available — even years later.

---

## Security

### 🔐 How are my passwords protected?
Every credential is **encrypted with AES-128 in CBC mode**, using a key derived from your Master PIN.  
The encryption key never leaves the device, and all data in memory is unreadable without it.

Even if someone physically extracts the memory chip, the data inside looks like random noise.

---

### 🧠 What happens if I forget my PIN?
For security reasons, there is **no PIN recovery**.  
The only option is a **Factory Reset**, which wipes all encrypted data and lets you create a new PIN.  
This ensures that no one — not even the manufacturer — can access your information.

> 💡 Tip: Choose a memorable PIN and avoid storing it digitally.

---

### 🕐 Does it connect to the Internet?
Never.  
ZeroKeyUSB is a **fully offline system**.  
It has no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or NFC modules, and it never exchanges data with external servers.  
You are the only one who can access the stored information.

---

### 💾 Can someone clone my device?
No.  
Each ZeroKeyUSB generates a **unique cryptographic identity** during its first initialization, including a random IV (Initialization Vector) and a hardware-bound signature.  
Even if another device uses the same PIN, its encryption pattern will be completely different.

---

### 🚫 What happens after too many wrong PIN attempts?
Each failed attempt triggers a progressively longer waiting period before you can try again:

| Failed attempts | Waiting time |
|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | 5 seconds |
| 2 | 10 seconds |
| 3 | 20 seconds |
| 4 | 40 seconds |
| … | Up to 43 minutes |

This makes brute-force attacks impractical, even with physical access.

---

### 🧰 Can the firmware be updated?
No.  
The firmware is **pre-installed and sealed** for security and stability.  
It cannot be modified remotely, preventing malware or unauthorized updates.

However, the source code is open for public audit — you can verify what runs inside your device on [GitHub](https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb).

---

### 🔍 Is it really open source?
Yes — but open for **transparency**, not for modification.  
Publishing the code lets anyone verify that:
- There are no backdoors or data collection.  
- Encryption is standard and verifiable.  
- All functions operate exactly as described.

Your device runs a **sealed, signed version** of this same code.

---

## Usage

### 🧑‍💻 How many credentials can it store?
Up to **64 encrypted credentials**, each containing:
- Website or service name  
- Username or email  
- Password  
- (Optional) 2FA secret for generating TOTP codes

---

### 🧾 Can I back up my data?
Yes.  
Use **Menu → Backup → Export** to send an encrypted list of credentials to your computer via USB serial.  
You can later **Import** the same backup if needed, as long as you use the same Master PIN.

> 🔒 Backup files are still encrypted — they are useless without your PIN.

---

### ⏱️ How does the 2FA (TOTP) feature work?
ZeroKeyUSB can generate **time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)** offline, just like Google Authenticator.  
Once you add a TOTP secret to a credential, the device can display your current 6-digit code with a countdown timer — without needing your phone or Internet.

---

### 🌍 The keyboard types wrong symbols — what can I do?
Go to **Menu → Settings → Keyboard Layout** and choose your language:  
`US`, `ES`, `FR`, `DE`, etc.  
This ensures that special characters (like `@` or `!`) match your system keyboard layout.

---

### 🧼 Is it waterproof?
Yes.  
Each ZeroKeyUSB unit is **fully resin-encapsulated**, making it resistant to water, dust, and everyday wear.  
It is not designed for submersion, but it will survive accidental spills or rain exposure.

---

### 🧱 What if the screen breaks?
Your data remains safe — it’s still encrypted inside the EEPROM.  
However, you’ll need to contact support for a replacement, as the device cannot be disassembled or repaired without breaking the resin seal.

---

### 🛡️ How long will it last?
ZeroKeyUSB has no moving parts or batteries.  
All components are rated for **tens of thousands of hours of operation**.  
With normal use, it should last **well over a decade**.
