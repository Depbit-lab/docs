## Welcome to ZeroKeyUSB

ZeroKeyUSB arrives **ready to use out of the box**.  
All firmware, security modules, and memory structures are already pre-installed and tested at the factory.  
When you plug it in for the first time, it will guide you through a simple one-time setup process.

---

### Step 1: Power on and initialization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="usb-drive" title="Connect ZeroKeyUSB">
    Plug your device into any **USB-C port** on your computer, tablet, or phone.  
    ZeroKeyUSB is powered entirely by the USB connection ‚Äî it has **no internal battery**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="display" title="Automatic startup">
    On first power-up, ZeroKeyUSB automatically initializes:
    - The **OLED screen** (128√ó32 pixels)
    - The **touch controller TS06** (five golden touch sensors)
    - The **secure EEPROM** (M24C64-WMN6TP)
    - A unique **AES-128 initialization vector (IV)** and a **device serial number**

    You will see the message:

    ```
    First Startup
    ZeroKey USB
    Touch the golden dots
    Right to continue ‚Üí
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 2: Create your Master PIN

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Enter your new PIN">
    Use the **five golden touch dots** to navigate the setup screens:

    - **Right ‚Üí** Continue  
    - **Left ‚Üí** Go back  
    - **Up / Down ‚Üí** Change digit  
    - **Center ‚Üí** Confirm

    Choose a PIN between **4 and 16 digits**.  
    This will become your **encryption key** ‚Äî every stored credential is protected by it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Security behind your PIN">
    Your PIN is used to:
    - Derive the **AES-128 key** that encrypts all credentials.
    - Create a unique **signature** stored in EEPROM (verified at each unlock).
    - Lock access after multiple failed attempts, with exponential wait times.

    <Tip>ZeroKeyUSB never stores or transmits your PIN in plain text.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 3: Store your credentials

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="folder-key" title="Add a new credential">
    After unlocking, you‚Äôll see the main screen with three fields:

    ```
    üåê  site.com
    üë§  username
    üîí  password
    ```

    Each credential is divided internally into **three encrypted EEPROM pages**:
    - Site name (32 bytes)
    - Username (32 bytes)
    - Password (32 bytes)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="fingerprint" title="Navigation controls">
    - **Up / Down:** Change character  
    - **Left / Right:** Move cursor  
    - **Center:** Confirm or save  
    - **Right (long press):** Move to next credential slot  
    - **Left (long press):** Return to menu
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="keyboard" title="Auto-type your credentials">
    When you select a site and press **Center**, ZeroKeyUSB acts as a USB keyboard and types:
    1. Your username (expanding automatically if it ends in `@`)
    2. A tab key
    3. Your password  

    It supports multiple keyboard layouts (`US`, `ES`, `FR`, `DE`, etc.), stored in the EEPROM and changeable via the Settings menu.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 4: (Optional) Add a 2FA secret

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Offline TOTP generator">
    ZeroKeyUSB can generate **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)** completely offline.  
    To add one, use the web manager or a compatible host application to send an `otpauth://` URI to the device (e.g. from an authenticator app).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="timer" title="Display 2FA codes">
    From the main screen, scroll down to **‚Äú2FA‚Äù** if available.  
    If the device asks for time synchronization (`REQTIME`), send the host time once via the web manager ‚Äî it will store the epoch in EEPROM for future calculations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 5: Backup and maintenance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Backup your data">
    From the **Menu ‚Üí Backup ‚Üí Export**, ZeroKeyUSB can send all encrypted credentials over the USB serial interface in CSV format.  
    Use this option to save an offline backup before performing factory resets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Factory reset">
    To wipe the device completely:
    - Enter **Menu ‚Üí Danger Zone ‚Üí Factory Reset**
    - All credentials and the PIN signature will be erased
    - The device will restart in initial setup mode
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
