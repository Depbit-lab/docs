## Welcome to ZeroKeyUSB

**ZeroKeyUSB** arrives ready to use ‚Äî fully offline, preloaded with stable firmware and tested hardware.  
If you assembled or flashed your own unit, follow the same setup wizard after installation.

When powered for the first time, the device will guide you through a one-time initialization process.

---

### Step 1: Power on and initialization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="usb-drive" title="Connect ZeroKeyUSB">
    Plug your device into any **USB-C port** on your computer, tablet, or phone.  
    ZeroKeyUSB is powered entirely by the USB connection ‚Äî it has **no internal battery**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="display" title="Automatic startup">
    On first power-up, ZeroKeyUSB automatically initializes:
    - The **OLED display** (128√ó32 pixels, monochrome)
    - The **touch controller TS06** (five golden touch sensors)
    - The **secure EEPROM** (M24C64-WMN6TP)
    - Generates a new **AES-128 initialization vector (IV)** if none is found in EEPROM
    - Reads the hardware **serial number** from the SAMD21 unique ID registers

    You will see the message:

    ```
    First Startup
    ZeroKey USB
    Touch any golden dot
    ‚Üí to continue
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 2: Create your Master PIN

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Enter your new PIN">
    Use the **five golden touch dots** to navigate the setup screens:

    - **Right ‚Üí** Continue  
    - **Left ‚Üí** Go back  
    - **Up / Down ‚Üí** Change digit  
    - **Center ‚Üí** Confirm

    Choose a PIN between **4 and 16 digits**.  
    This PIN acts directly as the **AES-128 encryption key** ‚Äî all stored credentials are protected by it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Security behind your PIN">
    Your PIN is used to:
    - Derive the **AES-128 key** that encrypts all credentials  
    - Create a unique **signature** stored in EEPROM (verified on each unlock)  
    - Reject incorrect PIN entries but allow unlimited retries

    <Tip>ZeroKeyUSB never stores or transmits your PIN in plain text.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 3: Store your credentials

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="folder-key" title="Add a new credential">
    After unlocking, you‚Äôll see the main screen with three fields:

    ```
    üåê  site.com
    üë§  username
    üîí  password
    ```

    Each credential is divided into **three encrypted EEPROM pages**:
    - Site name (32 bytes)
    - Username (32 bytes)
    - Password (32 bytes)

    ZeroKeyUSB can store up to **64 credentials** in total.  
    Long fields automatically **scroll** on the OLED display.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="fingerprint" title="Navigation controls">
    - **Up / Down:** Change character  
    - **Left / Right:** Move cursor  
    - **Center:** Confirm or save  
    - **Right (long press):** Move to next credential slot  
    - **Left (long press):** Return to menu
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="keyboard" title="Auto-type your credentials">
    When you select a site and press **Center**, ZeroKeyUSB acts as a USB keyboard and types:
    1. Your username (expanding automatically if it ends with `@`)  
    2. A **Tab** key  
    3. Your password  

    The firmware uses a **US-QWERTY** keyboard layout by default.  
    For non-US layouts, you may need to adjust special characters on the host system.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 4: (Optional) Add a 2FA secret

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Offline TOTP generator">
    ZeroKeyUSB can generate **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)** completely offline.  
    You can import a **Base32-encoded TOTP secret** via the local web manager (see the TOTP documentation for details).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="timer" title="Display 2FA codes">
    From the main screen, scroll down to **‚Äú2FA‚Äù** if a secret exists.  
    If the device displays `REQTIME`, it is requesting the current epoch time.  
    Send the host time once via the web manager ‚Äî the value will be saved in EEPROM and reused until a new sync is performed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Step 5: Backup and maintenance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Backup your data">
    From the **Menu ‚Üí Backup ‚Üí Export**, ZeroKeyUSB can send all credentials over the USB serial interface in CSV format.  
    Data is transmitted in **plain text**, so handle backups securely and keep them offline.
    You can later re-import them through the web manager‚Äôs restore option.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Factory reset">
    To wipe the device completely:
    - Enter **Menu ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zone ‚Üí Factory Reset**
    - All credentials, TOTP secrets, and the PIN signature will be erased
    - The device will restart in initial setup mode  
    <Tip>This action cannot be undone. Make sure you have a backup first.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
