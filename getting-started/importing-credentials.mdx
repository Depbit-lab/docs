description: "How to load existing passwords, usernames, and TOTP secrets into your ZeroKeyUSB."
---

ZeroKeyUSB keeps credentials offline inside the encrypted EEPROM, so imports must happen **after unlocking the device** and require **physical confirmation** on the touch controls.

<Alert>
Only import secrets from sources you trust. Imported records overwrite the selected slot immediately.
</Alert>

## What you can import

| Data type | Source format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Site / service name | Plain text (32 bytes max) | Long names automatically scroll on the OLED screen. |
| Username | Plain text (32 bytes max) | Trailing `@` expands to the host domain when auto-typing. |
| Password | Plain text (32 bytes max) | All characters are accepted; stored encrypted in EEPROM. |
| TOTP secret | Base32 (RFC 4648) | Optional; stored in a dedicated encrypted page. |

Each credential occupies three or four 32-byte EEPROM pages. The import process validates that the incoming data respects these limits before committing it.

## Import methods

### 1. Local web manager (recommended)

1. Connect ZeroKeyUSB and unlock it with your Master PIN.
2. Launch the **ZeroKeyUSB Web Manager** (served locally through the companion utility).
3. Open **Credentials → Import** and choose a `.csv` or `.json` file exported previously.
4. The manager converts every row into serial commands and sends them over the secure CDC channel.
5. Confirm the overwrite on the device when prompted (`Hold center to confirm`).

<Note>
The web manager never stores your credentials in the browser cache. Close the window when you finish importing.
</Note>

### 2. Command-line utility

1. Unlock the device.
2. Run `zerokeyusb-cli import backup.csv` (available in the firmware repository).
3. The CLI parses the CSV, streams it line-by-line, and verifies acknowledgements.
4. Follow the on-screen confirmation prompts on ZeroKeyUSB.

This approach is ideal for automated or scripted deployments. The CLI exits with a non-zero status if any slot fails to write.

### 3. Manual serial session

For complete transparency you can interact with the serial port directly:

```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
IMPORT
<CSV row 1>
<CSV row 2>
...
<Ctrl+A> <\>
```

- Send `IMPORT` to place the firmware in import mode.
- Paste each CSV row: `slot,site,username,password,totpSecret`.
- End the session or send an empty line to finalize.
- Approve the operation on the device.

Use this method only on trusted machines because the credentials stay visible in terminal history.

## CSV layout

```
slot,site,username,password,totp
0,example.com,alice@example.com,mY$up3rS3cret,
1,mail.example.com,alice,correct horse battery staple,JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
```

- `slot` ranges from `0` to `63`.
- `totp` is optional; leave blank if no 2FA secret.
- Fields containing commas should be quoted.

During import the firmware wipes the destination slot first, then writes each page sequentially to avoid partial corruption.

---

## Conflict handling

- **Empty slots** are filled immediately.
- **Occupied slots** require you to hold the center touch pad for three seconds to confirm overwrite.
- If the CSV references a slot outside the 0–63 range, the row is skipped and reported back to the host.
- Invalid Base32 secrets are rejected and leave the slot unchanged.

<Alert type="warning">
Imports cannot be undone without a prior backup. Always export your credentials before running a bulk import.
</Alert>

## After importing

1. Browse the credential list to verify each entry.
2. Optionally trigger **Menu → Backup → Export** to capture the new state.
3. Safely disconnect the device using your operating system’s eject feature.

Following these steps ensures your imported passwords remain encrypted and recoverable solely from your ZeroKeyUSB.
