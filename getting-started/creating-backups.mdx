Keeping an offline backup ensures you can recover your passwords if the device is lost or damaged. ZeroKeyUSB makes the process deliberate so that no credentials are leaked accidentally.

---

## When to back up

- After a large import or migration
- When you add or update several credentials
- Before performing firmware experiments or a factory reset
- Prior to shipping the device or storing it long-term

A fresh backup guarantees that your exported file reflects the current encrypted EEPROM state.

---

## Backup formats

| Format | Description | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSV (`backup.csv`) | Human-readable, comma-separated rows | Quick manual edits or spreadsheet review (remember the file is plain text). |
| Encrypted archive (`backup.zkx`) | AES-128 encrypted using your Master PIN | Created via the CLI utility for long-term cold storage. |

CSV exports are generated directly by the firmware over the serial channel. Encrypted archives are produced by host-side tools after receiving the CSV, so you retain control over how and where the file is protected.

---

## Exporting from the device

1. Unlock ZeroKeyUSB.
2. Navigate to **Menu → Backup → Export**.
3. Connect the device to your computer with a trusted USB cable.
4. Start the **web manager** or the **`zerokeyusb-cli`** in listen mode:

```bash
zerokeyusb-cli listen --output backup.csv
```

5. Confirm the export on the device by holding the center touch sensor.
6. The firmware streams each credential as a CSV line: `slot,site,username,password,totp`.

The export completes when the device sends `EOF`. The host utility saves the file and verifies checksum totals to detect transmission errors.

---

## Storing the backup

- Rename the file with the current date, e.g., `2024-07-zerokeyusb.csv`.
- Encrypt it using a tool you trust (`gpg`, `age`, password-protected ZIP, etc.).
- Keep at least two copies in separate secure locations (e.g., encrypted USB drive + printed and sealed copy).
- Delete any temporary unencrypted versions from your downloads folder.

<Alert type="warning">
Backups contain all credentials in plain text. Treat them with the same care as your primary password store.

## Restoring a backup

1. Unlock the device and ensure it shows the main menu.
2. Run the CLI restore command:

```bash
zerokeyusb-cli restore backup.csv
```

3. The tool parses the file and sends one slot at a time using the `IMPORT` serial command.
4. On the device, hold the center pad to approve overwriting each occupied slot.
5. Wait for the `Restore complete` confirmation both on the host and on ZeroKeyUSB.

If you saved an encrypted `.zkx` archive, decrypt it locally first before running the restore command.

---

## Verifying the restore

After the process finishes:

- Browse a few credentials to confirm they match the backup.
- Trigger the **TOTP** screen (if used) to ensure secrets were restored correctly.
- Optionally perform a quick login test on a non-critical account.

When everything looks correct, create a new backup so your archive reflects the restored state.

---

## Automating regular backups

To avoid forgetting, schedule a reminder or a cron job that runs `zerokeyusb-cli export` monthly. Store the resulting file in an encrypted location and prune older versions according to your security policy.

With disciplined backups you can recover quickly from hardware loss without compromising the ZeroKeyUSB offline security model.
