## Welcome

**ZeroKeyUSB** is a standalone, hardware-based password manager designed to keep your credentials completely offline.  
It behaves like a USB keyboard — typing your encrypted usernames, passwords, and optional TOTP codes wherever you need them.  
No apps. No cloud. No subscriptions.

Everything you need to **assemble the hardware**, **understand the firmware**, and **keep your device secure** is organized below.

## Main Features

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Offline Encryption"
    icon="lock"
    href="/firmware/security"
  >
    Protects your data using **AES-128 CBC encryption**, where the Master PIN directly derives the encryption key.  
    No Internet connection is ever required.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Hardware Simplicity"
    icon="microchip"
    href="/hardware/overview"
  >
    Built around a **SAMD21 microcontroller** and **M24C64-W EEPROM**, fully powered by **USB-C**.  
    No batteries, no wireless chips — truly air-gapped.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Universal Keyboard Output"
    icon="keyboard"
    href="/firmware/usb-utilities"
  >
    Acts as a standard **USB HID keyboard (US-QWERTY)** to type credentials into any focused field.  
    Works across all major operating systems.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Integrated OLED Display"
    icon="display"
    href="/firmware/display"

    Navigate stored credentials and 2FA codes on a **128×32-pixel OLED screen** with auto-scroll for long text.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)"
    icon="clock"
    href="/firmware/totp"
  >
    Generate 6-digit 2FA codes **locally and offline**.  
    Requires a one-time **time sync** from the host via USB — never through the Internet.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Open Source & Transparent"
    icon="code"
    href="https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb"
  >
    Every line of firmware and hardware schematic is public.  
    Audit, verify, and contribute to improve the device.
