## Welcome

**ZeroKeyUSB** is a standalone, hardware-based password manager designed to keep your credentials completely offline.
It behaves like a USB keyboard — typing your encrypted usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes wherever you need them.
No apps. No cloud. No subscriptions.
The documentation below gathers everything you need to assemble the hardware, understand the firmware, and keep your device secure.
