## Offline by design

ZeroKeyUSB does not rely on the Internet, cloud storage, or companion apps.  
Everything — from encryption to key generation — happens **inside the device**, powered directly through USB.

This means your passwords **never leave the hardware** and **cannot be accessed remotely**, even by the manufacturer.

---

## Encryption architecture

All sensitive data is stored in the internal **EEPROM M24C64-WMN6TP** memory, encrypted using **AES-128 CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**.  
The encryption key is derived from your **Master PIN**, which only you know and which is never saved in plain text.

| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Encryption algorithm** | AES-128 in CBC mode (industry-standard symmetric cipher). |
| **Key source** | Derived directly from your PIN. |
| **IV (Initialization Vector)** | Randomly generated from analog noise and stored securely in memory. |
| **Data blocks** | Each credential uses three 32-byte encrypted pages (site, username, password). |
| **Verification** | Each page is checked after write to ensure data integrity. |

If you remove the EEPROM from the board and try to read it, you will only see **random binary noise** — no readable strings or patterns.

## The Master PIN

Your PIN acts as your personal encryption key.  
It is never transmitted, stored in plain text, or shared with any external system.

When you enter your PIN:
1. ZeroKeyUSB derives a 128-bit AES key from it.  
2. This key decrypts a small “signature block” stored in memory.  
3. If the result matches the expected pattern, access is granted.  
4. If it doesn’t, the device enforces a delay before another attempt.

### Intelligent lockout

Each incorrect PIN attempt increases the waiting time **exponentially**:

| Failed attempts | Wait time |
|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 5 seconds |
| 2 | 10 seconds |
| 3 | 20 seconds |
| 4 | 40 seconds |
| 5 | 80 seconds |
| … | up to 2560 seconds (≈ 43 minutes) |

This protection prevents brute-force attacks and ensures that only the rightful owner can access stored data.

---

## Secure Initialization Vector (IV)

Every device generates a unique **Initialization Vector (IV)** on its first startup.  
This IV is produced using **hardware entropy** — random noise read from a floating analog pin on the SAMD21 microcontroller — and stored inside the EEPROM.

If the IV ever becomes corrupted, the device automatically regenerates a new one using fresh entropy.

This guarantees that **no two ZeroKeyUSB devices share the same encryption pattern**, even if they use the same PIN.

---

## Data segmentation

To minimize the risk of data leaks, each credential is split into **independent encrypted pages**:
- Page 1 → Site or domain  
- Page 2 → Username  
- Page 3 → Password  

If one section becomes corrupted or is intentionally erased, it does not affect the others.  
This segmented design also prevents attackers from recognizing patterns between credentials.

---

## Tamper protection

- The entire circuit is **encapsulated in resin**, making physical access to components nearly impossible without destroying them.  
- No wireless communication modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC) are present.  
- The firmware is **static and signed**, preventing unauthorized modification.  
- All actions requiring sensitive data occur **only in volatile memory (RAM)** and are immediately cleared after use.

---

## Transparency, not dependence

ZeroKeyUSB’s firmware is fully open-source and publicly available for **audit and verification** — not for modification.  
Anyone can review the implementation of encryption, IV handling, and access logic to confirm that:
- There are **no backdoors or remote commands**.  
- All cryptographic operations are performed **locally and deterministically**.  
- Your security does not depend on blind trust in the manufacturer.

You never need to update, reprogram, or connect your device to stay secure — it’s safe by design.

<Note>
ZeroKeyUSB’s encryption follows the same core principles used in certified security tokens and hardware wallets — but with a focus on simplicity, transparency, and offline usability.
