## Offline by design

ZeroKeyUSB does not rely on the Internet, cloud storage, or companion apps.  
Everything — from encryption to key handling — happens **inside the device**, powered directly through USB.

Your passwords **never leave the hardware** and **cannot be accessed remotely**, even by the manufacturer.

---

## Encryption architecture

All sensitive data is stored in the external **EEPROM M24C64-WMN6TP**, encrypted using **AES-128 CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**.  
The encryption key is taken directly from your **Master PIN**, which is never stored or transmitted in plain text.

| Element | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Encryption algorithm** | AES-128 in CBC mode (industry-standard symmetric cipher). |
| **Key source** | Directly uses the Master PIN as the 128-bit key. |
| **IV (Initialization Vector)** | Generated from analog noise on first startup and stored securely in EEPROM. |
| **Data blocks** | Each credential uses three 32-byte encrypted pages (site, username, password). |
| **Verification** | Each write is confirmed via I²C acknowledgment to ensure completion. |

If the EEPROM were removed from the board, its contents would appear as **random ciphertext**, with no recognizable structure or patterns.

## The Master PIN

Your PIN acts as your personal encryption key.  
It is never transmitted, stored in plain text, or shared with any external system.

When you enter your PIN:
1. ZeroKeyUSB uses it directly as the AES-128 key.  
2. This key decrypts an 8-byte **signature block** stored in EEPROM.  
3. If the decrypted result matches the expected pattern, access is granted.  
4. Otherwise, the failed-attempt counter increments and the device enforces a delay before retry.

### Intelligent lockout

Each incorrect PIN attempt increases the waiting time **exponentially**, and the count is stored persistently in EEPROM (`0x0002`):

| Failed attempts | Wait time |
|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 5 seconds |
| 2 | 10 seconds |
| 3 | 20 seconds |
| 4 | 40 seconds |
| 5 | 80 seconds |
| … | up to 2560 seconds (≈ 43 minutes) |

This mechanism prevents brute-force attempts and persists even after unplugging the device.

---

## Secure Initialization Vector (IV)

Every device generates a unique **Initialization Vector** on first startup.  
The IV is created using **analog noise** read from a floating pin on the SAMD21 and saved in the EEPROM.  
If the IV becomes corrupted or missing, it is regenerated automatically with fresh entropy.

A single IV per device is used for all AES operations, ensuring every encryption chain is unique to that specific unit.

---

## Data segmentation

Each credential is divided into **independent encrypted pages** to minimize correlation:

- Page 1 → Site or domain  
- Page 2 → Username  
- Page 3 → Password  
- Page 4 (optional) → TOTP secret  

This segmented structure isolates corruption, avoids recognizable patterns, and extends memory endurance.

---

## Tamper protection

- The entire PCB is **encapsulated in epoxy resin**, making component access virtually impossible without destroying the device.  
- **No wireless interfaces** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC) are present.  
- The firmware is **static** — flashed at the factory and cannot be updated remotely.  
- All sensitive operations occur only in **temporary RAM buffers**, which are cleared immediately after use.

---

## Transparency, not dependence

ZeroKeyUSB’s firmware is fully open-source and available for public **audit and verification**.  
Anyone can review how encryption, IV handling, and access control are implemented to confirm that:

- There are **no backdoors or remote commands**.  
- All cryptographic processes occur **locally and deterministically**.  
- Security depends on design, not trust.

ZeroKeyUSB intentionally avoids OTA or wireless updates — physical access is required for reflashing if ever needed.

<Note>
ZeroKeyUSB’s encryption follows the same core principles found in certified hardware tokens and wallets —  
with a focus on simplicity, transparency, and complete offline operation.
