## Secure Signing Architecture

To protect the **BLAKE2s Secret Key** (`ZK_SECRET_KEY`) and keep the WebTool public, ZeroKeyUSB uses an **Offline Signing** process.

### üîë The Secret: Signing Key

* **Residence:** The 32-byte secret key exists only within the private **Offline Signer Tool** and the device's Bootloader itself.
* **Function:** The key is used to calculate the **BLAKE2s MAC** of the firmware.
* **Security:** Since the WebTool is public, this approach ensures that **no user or attacker can extract the signing key** to create their own official firmware.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Signing Process (Offline)

1.  **Input:** The firmware binary (`firmware.bin`) ready for release.
2.  **Calculation:** The tool calculates the **CRC32** and the **BLAKE2s MAC** (16 bytes) of the file.
3.  **Footer Creation:** It assembles the **Security Footer** structure with the Magic Number, code length, CRC32, and MAC.
4.  **Concatenation:** The footer is **concatenated** to the end of the firmware binary.
5.  **Output:** A single **pre-signed binary file** (`firmware_signed_footer.bin`) is produced, ready to be uploaded by the public WebTool.

### üì¶ Reproducibility and Transparency

Although the signing key is secret, the firmware remains **Open Source and auditable**. The process ensures that:

* Only the development team can create a binary that the Bootloader accepts as official (skipping the 15-second delay).
* The principle is maintained that **there are no remote signing or update mechanisms**.
