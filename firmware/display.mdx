## 128×32 pixels with purpose

ZeroKeyUSB uses a **white OLED panel (SSD1306 controller)** with a 128×32 resolution.
The firmware keeps the interface intentionally minimal: large typography, clear icons, and smooth scroll areas that work even in low light.

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│ MENU                  │
│ > Backup              │
│   Settings            │
│   TOTP                │
│   Danger Zone         │
│   Info                │
└───────────────────────┘
```

Every screen uses a 1-bit frame buffer stored in SRAM and transferred over I²C at 400 kHz.

## Rendering pipeline

1. **Frame buffer build** – the application composes the entire screen in RAM using helper functions such as `draw_text()`, `draw_icon()`, and `draw_progress()`.
2. **Diff detection** – only the pages that changed since the last frame are sent to the OLED, reducing I²C traffic.
3. **VSync pacing** – a 60 Hz timer ensures updates feel immediate without flicker.

This approach keeps the display responsive even while the device computes encryption or TOTP codes.

## Typography & icons

| Asset            | Format  | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Main font**    | Custom 6×12 bitmap | Used for menus, lists, and info screens. |
| **Mono font**    | 8×12 bitmap | Optimized for passwords and 2FA codes.       |
| **Icons**        | 16×16 sprites | Backup, settings, clock, warning, info.     |

Fonts are embedded directly in flash memory. When a password is displayed or typed, the characters are rendered using the mono font to avoid ambiguity between similar glyphs (e.g., `O` vs `0`).

## Scrolling & focus

- **Auto-scroll** – long site names scroll horizontally with easing to remain readable.
- **Focus highlight** – the currently selected option is inverted, while others stay dimmed.
- **Long-press feedback** – a filling progress bar appears during destructive confirmations (factory reset, delete all).

Animations are performed through lightweight tweening functions that never block the main loop.

---

## Secure display practices

- Sensitive fields (passwords, TOTP secrets) are **masked by default** and only revealed for a few seconds when the user confirms the action.
- After typing credentials, the firmware clears the frame buffer to remove any residual characters from RAM.
- If the device remains idle for **60 seconds**, it automatically returns to the lock screen and wipes the buffer again.

## Diagnostics view

A hidden diagnostic screen (accessible only during factory testing) shows I²C bus status, touch raw values, and firmware version.
It is **disabled** in production builds to avoid leaking debugging information.

<Note>
The OLED is encapsulated behind the resin window, making it resilient to scratches and moisture while keeping contrast pristine.
