title: "Web Time Sync Tool"
description: "Use the browser-based helper to send accurate Unix time to ZeroKeyUSB."
---

The ZeroKeyUSB firmware repository includes a lightweight web application that runs locally in your browser. It connects to the device over WebUSB and pushes the current epoch so TOTP codes stay in sync.

---

## Requirements

- Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave) with WebUSB enabled
- ZeroKeyUSB unlocked and connected via USB-C
- Local copy of the **`tools/web-time-sync`** directory served via `npm run dev`

No Internet access is necessary once the page is loaded.

---

## Launching the tool

```bash
cd tools/web-time-sync
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser. You should see the ZeroKeyUSB logo and a “Connect” button.

---

## Sending the time

1. Click **Connect** and select your ZeroKeyUSB from the device list (`ZeroKeyUSB CDC`).
2. The page displays the current Unix epoch and a countdown to the next 30-second boundary.
3. Press **Sync now** when the device requests time (shows `REQTIME`).
4. The tool sends `SETTIME <epoch>` automatically and confirms success with a toast notification.

If the device was already in sync, it responds with `OK` and no changes are made.

---

## Safety features

- The tool only communicates with USB devices whose vendor/product IDs match ZeroKeyUSB.
- All commands are visible in the on-screen console for auditability.
- No data leaves the browser tab; telemetry and analytics are disabled.

<Alert>
Close the tab when finished. Leaving WebUSB connections open can prevent other applications from accessing the serial port.
</Alert>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Browser cannot access USB | Make sure you are using a Chromium browser and have granted device permissions. |
| `Failed to send epoch` | The device might be locked; unlock it and try again. |
| Tool closes unexpectedly | Check the terminal running `npm run dev` for errors and restart the dev server. |

The web time sync tool offers a user-friendly way to keep your hardware authenticator aligned without installing heavyweight software.
