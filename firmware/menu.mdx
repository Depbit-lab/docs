## Simple control, powerful features

ZeroKeyUSB has no buttons, no apps, and no hidden menus ‚Äî only **five golden touch points** that control everything you need.

From navigating credentials to backing up your data, every function is available through a clean on-screen menu designed for clarity and safety.

---

## Navigating the interface

The capacitive touch controls are intuitive and responsive:

| Gesture | Action |
|----------|---------|
| **Right ‚Üí** | Move forward / Confirm / Open submenu |
| **Left ‚Üê** | Go back / Exit current screen |
| **Up ‚Üë / Down ‚Üì** | Scroll through options or change characters |
| **Center ‚Ä¢** | Select / Confirm |
| **Long press** | Triggers special functions (e.g., factory reset confirmation) |

A small label at the top of the display indicates your current context (for example: `MENU`, `SITE`, `TOTP`, or `SETUP`).

## Main menu overview

When you enter the main menu, you‚Äôll see five sections:

1. **Backup**  
2. **Settings**  
3. **TOTP**  
4. **Danger Zone**  
5. **Info**

Each section is explained below.

---

### üîÅ Backup

ZeroKeyUSB allows you to **export and import** your encrypted database through the USB serial interface.

#### **Import credentials**
Used when restoring from a backup created on the same device.  
After selecting **Import**, ZeroKeyUSB waits for data sent from the web manager or another trusted source.  
The data must match the encryption key derived from your current PIN.

#### **Export credentials**
This generates a read-only CSV-like output over USB serial, listing all your encrypted credentials.  
Each entry includes site, username, password, and optional TOTP secret (if present).  
Export is protected by the PIN ‚Äî no decryption is possible without it.

> üí° **Tip:** Always back up before performing a factory reset.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Personalize how your ZeroKeyUSB behaves ‚Äî without ever connecting it to the Internet.

#### **Rotate Screen**
Flips the display orientation (useful for left- or right-handed operation).

#### **Keyboard Layout**
Select the output language layout for USB keyboard emulation:  
`US`, `ES`, `FR`, `DE`, `IT`, `PT`, `SV`, and others.  
This ensures passwords and special characters are typed correctly on any system.

#### **About**
Displays software version, serial number, and a link to the open-source repository:  
ZeroKey USB
SW 1.0.0
SN XXXXXXXX

### ‚è±Ô∏è TOTP

If a credential includes a **two-factor authentication (2FA)** secret, you can generate a time-based code directly from the device.

When you enter **TOTP**:
- If the current time has not been set, the screen shows  
  `Time not set ‚Üí Request host time`.  
- Once synchronized, a six-digit code appears with a countdown timer (30 seconds).  
- The code refreshes automatically at the end of each interval.

ZeroKeyUSB supports:
- **SHA-1**, **SHA-256**, and **SHA-512** algorithms.  
- Secure storage of the TOTP secret, encrypted in EEPROM alongside your credentials.

> üîí The TOTP system works entirely offline. No app or cloud sync is ever required.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zone

Actions inside this section are **irreversible** and protected by on-screen confirmation.

#### **Reset PIN**
Resets the master PIN and requires full re-authentication.  
All stored credentials remain intact, but you must verify the new PIN before continuing.

#### **Delete Credentials**
Erases the encrypted database of sites, usernames, passwords, and TOTP secrets.  
The device will display a visual countdown before performing the deletion.

#### **Factory Reset**
Completely restores ZeroKeyUSB to its original state:  
- Wipes all memory, including PIN signature and IV.  
- Regenerates a new encryption seed at startup.  
- Returns the device to first-time setup mode.

> üß† During deletion, the screen displays:  
> ‚ÄúCritical process ‚Äî unplug to cancel.‚Äù  
> This prevents accidental erasure.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

A quick way to view essential device information:

- **Software version** ‚Äî e.g. `SW 1.0.0`  
- **Serial number** ‚Äî unique per device, hardware-bound  
- **Open-source link** ‚Äî directs to [github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb](https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb)

Use this section to verify authenticity or to confirm your device runs the latest stable firmware version preloaded by the manufacturer.

---

## Design philosophy

The menu system is intentionally minimalist:
- No nested complexity ‚Äî every option is two taps away.  
- No animations or distractions ‚Äî focused on clarity.  
- All operations are local and reversible (except for secure erasure).  
- The interface remains identical across all hardware revisions.

ZeroKeyUSB is built for **confidence, not configuration**.  
Once you learn the gestures, you can operate it entirely from muscle memory ‚Äî safely, silently, and offline.

<Note>
You don‚Äôt need to install software or drivers.  
ZeroKeyUSB is recognized as a standard USB keyboard on any operating system.
