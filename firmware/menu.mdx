## Simple control, powerful features

ZeroKeyUSB has no buttons, no apps, and no hidden menus ‚Äî only **five golden touch points** that control everything you need.  
The main menu becomes accessible **after entering your Master PIN**.

From navigating credentials to backing up your data, every function is available through a clear on-screen interface designed for clarity and safety.

---

## Navigating the interface

The capacitive touch controls are intuitive and responsive:

| Gesture | Action |
|----------|---------|
| **Right ‚Üí** | Move forward / Confirm / Open submenu |
| **Left ‚Üê** | Go back / Exit current screen |
| **Up ‚Üë / Down ‚Üì** | Scroll through options or change characters |
| **Center ‚Ä¢** | Select / Confirm |
| **Long press** | Triggers special functions (e.g. factory-reset confirmation) |

A small label at the top of the display shows your current context (`MENU`, `SITE`, `TOTP`, or `SETUP`).

## Main menu overview

When you enter the main menu, you‚Äôll see five sections:

1. **Backup**  
2. **Settings**  
3. **TOTP**  
4. **Danger Zone**  
5. **Info**

Each section is explained below.

---

### üîÅ Backup

ZeroKeyUSB allows you to **export and import** credentials through the USB serial interface.

#### **Import credentials**
Used to restore data previously exported from the same device.  
After selecting **Import**, ZeroKeyUSB waits for data sent from the local web manager or a trusted terminal.  
If the current PIN differs from the one used to create the backup, restoration will fail.

#### **Export credentials**
Sends all stored entries over USB serial in **plain CSV-like text** (site, username, password, optional TOTP).  
Although data is decrypted for transmission, it is never stored externally unless you save it manually.

> üí° **Tip:** Always make a local backup before performing a factory reset, and keep it offline.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Adjust how your ZeroKeyUSB behaves ‚Äî always offline.

#### **Rotate Screen**
Flips the display orientation for left- or right-handed use.

#### **Keyboard Layout**
The device emulates a **US-QWERTY keyboard**.  
Other layouts (ES, FR, DE‚Ä¶) are not stored internally; hosts with different layouts may need to adjust special characters.

#### **About**
Displays firmware information in a read-only screen:  
ZeroKey USB
SW 1.0.0
SN XXXXXXXX
github.com/Depbit-lab


---

### ‚è±Ô∏è TOTP

If a credential includes a **two-factor authentication (2FA)** secret, you can generate a time-based code directly from the device.

When entering **TOTP**:
- If time has not been set, the screen shows  
  `Time not set ‚Üí Request host time`.  
- Once synchronized, a six-digit code appears with a 30 s countdown.  
- The code refreshes automatically at the end of each interval.

Currently, ZeroKeyUSB implements **SHA-1** (RFC 6238).  
Future firmware versions may include optional **SHA-256** and **SHA-512**.

> üîí The TOTP system works entirely offline. No app or cloud sync is ever required.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zone

Actions inside this section are **irreversible** and require long-press confirmation.

#### **Reset PIN**
Resets the Master PIN and erases all stored data.  
The device restarts in initial setup mode and generates a new encryption seed.

#### **Delete Credentials**
Erases all sites, usernames, passwords, and TOTP secrets.  
A visual countdown appears before the deletion begins.  
> üß† During deletion, the screen displays:  
> ‚ÄúCritical process ‚Äî unplug to cancel.‚Äù

#### **Factory Reset**
Fully restores the device to factory state:  
- Wipes all memory, including PIN signature and IV.  
- Regenerates a new encryption seed.  
- Returns to first-time setup.

---

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

A quick way to view essential device information:

- **Software version** ‚Äî e.g. `SW 1.0.0`  
- **Serial number** ‚Äî unique per device, hardware-bound  
- **Open-source link** ‚Äî [github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb](https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb)

All information is read-only and cannot be modified from the menu.

---

## Design philosophy

The menu system is intentionally minimalist:
- No deep submenus ‚Äî every option is two taps away.  
- No unnecessary animations ‚Äî focused on clarity.  
- All operations are local and reversible (except secure erasure).  
- Layout and gestures remain consistent across firmware versions.  

ZeroKeyUSB is built for **confidence, not configuration**.  
Once you learn the gestures, you can operate it entirely from muscle memory ‚Äî safely, silently, and offline.

<Note>
ZeroKeyUSB requires no drivers or software installation.  
It‚Äôs recognized as a standard USB keyboard on any operating system.
