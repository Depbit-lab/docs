ZeroKeyUSB uses a **0.91" SSD1306-based OLED module** to present menus, credentials, and status icons. The display is bright, low-power, and readable from multiple angles — ideal for a quick glance during logins.

## Electrical characteristics

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Resolution | 128 × 32 pixels |
| Interface | I²C (address `0x3C`) |
| Supply voltage | 3.3 V |
| Typical current | 10–12 mA at full brightness |
| Controller | Solomon Systech SSD1306 |

The module connects directly to the SAMD21’s SERCOM3 I²C bus, shared with the external EEPROM. Pull-up resistors (4.7 kΩ) are located on the PCB, so the breakout resistors should be disabled when assembling.

## Pin assignments

| OLED pin | Signal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VCC | 3V3 | Powered from the MCU regulator |
| GND | GND | Common ground |
| SCL | PA23 | Shared I²C clock |
| SDA | PA22 | Shared I²C data |
| RES | PA14 | Controlled by firmware during init |
| DC | Tied low | Command/data handled automatically in I²C mode |
| CS | Tied low | Not used in I²C mode |

The firmware toggles the **RES** line during startup to ensure a clean boot sequence even if power is unstable.

## Frame buffer strategy

- The SSD1306 expects data in **pages of 8 vertical pixels**.
- Firmware maintains a 512-byte buffer in SRAM (`128 × 32 / 8`).
- Updates use **partial writes** to minimize I²C traffic when only a few characters change.
- A simple double-buffer diff tracks dirty regions so the screen refresh stays under 5 ms.

Animations such as smooth scrolling for long passwords rely on timer interrupts that shift the buffer between refreshes.

---

## Brightness control

- Default contrast value: `0x7F` (50%).
- Menu option allows dimming down to `0x20` for dark environments.
- After 60 seconds of inactivity the firmware sends `DISPLAY OFF` while keeping data in RAM.
- Any touch input or USB activity turns the screen back on instantly.

This approach balances legibility and OLED lifespan.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Possible cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No image, backlight off | RES pin held low | Check solder joint or ensure the boot logo finished. |
| Display flashes or shows noise | I²C conflict with EEPROM | Inspect pull-up resistors and cable length. |
| Ghosting / burn-in | Static content at max brightness | Lower contrast or enable auto-dim in settings. |

If the OLED ever needs replacement, any SSD1306 I²C module with the same pin order can be swapped in without firmware changes.
