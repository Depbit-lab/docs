## Built for trust

ZeroKeyUSB is a self-contained, hardware-based password manager.  
It has been engineered with a single goal in mind: **to protect your credentials without ever connecting to the Internet**.

Each unit is assembled, tested, and encapsulated in **industrial-grade epoxy resin** to ensure that no external tampering can occur ‚Äî and that it remains waterproof, dust-proof, and maintenance-free for years.

## Core architecture

At its heart, ZeroKeyUSB integrates a microcontroller, a secure non-volatile memory, and a minimal user interface ‚Äî all optimized for **privacy, simplicity, and durability**.

| Component | Model | Purpose |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Main MCU** | Microchip SAMD21 | Executes encryption, menu logic, and USB keyboard emulation. |
| **Secure EEPROM** | ST M24C64-WMN6TP | Stores encrypted credentials, TOTP secrets, and configuration data. |
| **Display** | OLED 128√ó32 px (white) | Shows credentials, menu items, and 2FA codes. |
| **Touch Sensor** | TS06 (6-channel, 5 used) | Replaces mechanical buttons with durable capacitive input. |
| **USB Interface** | USB-C | Provides both power and data ‚Äî no battery or charging circuit required. |

All internal communication uses **I¬≤C** for memory access and **USB HID** for host interaction.  
Data written to the EEPROM is encrypted before transmission, so even if the I¬≤C bus were probed, stored information would remain unreadable.

## Why these components

### üß† SAMD21 microcontroller
The ARM¬Æ Cortex-M0+ processor balances performance, size, and power efficiency.  
It allows secure **AES-128 (CBC)** encryption in firmware while keeping the device fully offline.  
The USB interface implements standard **HID keyboard emulation** using a **US-QWERTY** layout for universal compatibility.

### üîê M24C64-W EEPROM
Chosen for its high reliability and write endurance (>1,000,000 cycles), this memory chip stores all encrypted user data.  
Each credential is divided into **three 32-byte encrypted blocks** ‚Äî one for site, one for username, and one for password ‚Äî totaling **96 bytes per entry**, aligned with the EEPROM memory map.  
The encryption key never leaves the MCU.  
Each write operation is confirmed at the I¬≤C level to ensure successful completion.

### üñêÔ∏è TS06 touch sensor
ZeroKeyUSB replaces physical buttons with a **sealed, six-channel capacitive touch controller**, of which five channels are actively used.  
The five golden touch points on the front panel provide intuitive navigation:
- **Up / Down:** Scroll or change characters  
- **Left / Right:** Move between fields  
- **Center:** Confirm selections  

Long presses perform shortcuts (e.g., next credential or return to menu), keeping the interface simple yet powerful.

### üí° OLED display
The 128√ó32-pixel OLED offers high contrast and excellent visibility, even in daylight.  
It displays site names, usernames, passwords, and real-time TOTP codes.  
Long fields automatically **scroll** for improved readability.

### ‚ö° USB-C connection
ZeroKeyUSB typically draws **under 20 mA** ‚Äî similar to a wireless mouse.  
Since it relies entirely on the host for power, there are **no batteries to charge or replace**, and it works on any device supporting USB keyboards (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, etc.).

## Designed for resilience

- **Encapsulated electronics** prevent corrosion, dust, and moisture ingress.  
- **No wireless interfaces** (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC) ‚Äî eliminating remote attack surfaces.  
- **Static, offline firmware** ‚Äî updates can only be done locally via USB bootloader, never remotely.  
- **Universal compatibility** ‚Äî recognized as a standard USB keyboard, requiring no drivers or apps.

## Transparency, not exposure

ZeroKeyUSB is **open source by philosophy, not by necessity**.  
The full firmware and hardware schematics are publicly available on  
[GitHub ‚Üí Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb](https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb),  
allowing anyone to verify exactly what code runs on their device ‚Äî without exposing private data.

You never need to modify or program your unit manually.  
It simply works, securely and offline, from the moment you plug it in.

<Note>
ZeroKeyUSB is a sealed product ‚Äî opening or reprogramming the device voids the warranty and destroys its waterproof encapsulation.
