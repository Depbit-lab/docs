## Built for trust

ZeroKeyUSB is a self-contained, hardware-based password manager.  
It has been engineered with a single goal in mind: **to protect your credentials without ever connecting to the Internet**.

Each unit is assembled, tested, and encapsulated in resin to ensure that no external tampering can occur ‚Äî and that it remains waterproof, dust-proof, and maintenance-free for years.

## Core architecture

At its heart, ZeroKeyUSB integrates a microcontroller, a secure non-volatile memory, and a minimal user interface ‚Äî all optimized for **privacy, simplicity, and durability**.

| Component | Model | Purpose |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Main MCU** | Microchip SAMD21 | Executes all encryption, menu logic, and USB keyboard emulation. |
| **Secure EEPROM** | ST M24C64-WMN6TP | Stores encrypted credentials, TOTP secrets, and device configuration. |
| **Display** | OLED 128√ó32 px (white) | Provides clear information on credentials and 2FA codes. |
| **Touch Sensor** | TS06 (6-channel) | Replaces mechanical buttons with durable capacitive touch input. |
| **USB Interface** | USB-C | Provides both power and data; no battery required. |

All communication between these components is handled via **I¬≤C** and **USB HID protocols**, using short encrypted data frames to ensure stability and integrity.

## Why these components

### üß† SAMD21 microcontroller
The ARM¬Æ Cortex-M0+ processor provides excellent balance between performance and power efficiency.  
It is used by many certified devices and allows **secure AES-128 operations in firmware** while keeping the system entirely offline.

### üîê M24C64-W EEPROM
Chosen for its proven reliability and extended write endurance (>1,000,000 cycles), this memory chip is where your credentials are stored.  
Each credential is divided into **three separate 32-byte encrypted blocks** (site, user, password).  
The encryption key never leaves the MCU, and every write is followed by a data verification step.

### üñêÔ∏è TS06 touch sensor
Instead of buttons that wear out, ZeroKeyUSB uses a sealed, six-channel capacitive touch controller.  
The golden points on the front allow intuitive navigation:
- **Up / Down** to scroll or change characters  
- **Left / Right** to navigate between fields  
- **Center** to confirm selections

Long presses trigger special functions (next credential, return to menu, etc.), ensuring the interface remains simple yet powerful.

### üí° OLED display
The 128√ó32-pixel OLED provides high contrast and wide viewing angles even in daylight.  
It shows site names, usernames, passwords, and dynamic TOTP codes.  
Large characters and a smooth auto-scroll system ensure readability without distractions.

### ‚ö° USB-C connection
ZeroKeyUSB draws less than 20 mA during operation ‚Äî about the same as a wireless mouse.  
Because it relies entirely on the host for power, there are **no batteries to charge or replace**, and it works with any device that accepts a USB keyboard (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and more).

## Designed for resilience

- **Encapsulated electronics** prevent corrosion, dust, and moisture ingress.  
- **No wireless interfaces** (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC) ‚Äî eliminating remote attack surfaces.  
- **Static, offline firmware** ‚Äî the device cannot be updated remotely.  
- **Universal compatibility** ‚Äî recognized as a standard USB keyboard, requiring no drivers or apps.

## Transparency, not exposure

ZeroKeyUSB is **open source by philosophy, not by necessity**.  
The full firmware and schematics are publicly available on [GitHub ‚Üí Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb](https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb),  
allowing independent verification of its security model ‚Äî without compromising your own privacy.

You never need to modify or program your device.  
It simply works, securely and offline, from the moment you plug it in.

<Note>
ZeroKeyUSB is a sealed product ‚Äî opening or reprogramming the device will void warranty and destroy its waterproof encapsulation.
