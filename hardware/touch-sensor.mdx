## Designed for durability

ZeroKeyUSB has **no moving parts**.\
Instead of fragile buttons or switches, it uses a **six-channel capacitive touch controller (TS06)** that detects precise finger contact through the device’s resin surface.

The result: a **sealed, wear-proof interface** that remains perfectly responsive even after years of daily use.

---

## How it works

The **TS06 touch controller** continuously monitors small electrical changes on five golden contact points located on the front surface of the device.\
When your finger approaches, the chip detects a shift in capacitance — instantly identifying which area has been touched.

This detection happens **thousands of times per second**, allowing smooth navigation without delay or misfires.

## Touch layout

The five golden points are arranged ergonomically in a cross pattern:

| Direction      | Function                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Up (↑)**     | Scroll or change character       |
| **Down (↓)**   | Reverse scroll or decrease value |
| **Left (←)**   | Go back / Previous screen        |
| **Right (→)**  | Continue / Confirm / Next        |
| **Center (•)** | Select or execute action         |

The sixth hidden channel is used internally to stabilize readings and filter out environmental noise.

## Short vs. long press

Each touch can be interpreted as a **short tap** or a **long press**, depending on duration:

| Press type      | Hold time | Typical use                                                                            |
| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short press** | \< 800 ms | Move, select, confirm                                                                  |
| **Long press**  | \> 800 ms | Trigger special actions (e.g., open menu, next credential, factory reset confirmation) |

The firmware uses an **adaptive debounce filter** to ensure reliable input even with wet fingers or slight contact.

## Visual feedback

When you touch a point, the OLED display reacts instantly with:

- **Highlight animation** for the selected option.
- **Progress indicator** for long presses.
- **Soft transitions** between menu screens.

This immediate feedback helps users feel confident that every action has been registered — even without sound or vibration.

## Why touch instead of buttons?

| Feature            | Physical buttons | ZeroKeyUSB touch system                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanical wear    | High             | None                                        |
| Water resistance   | Limited          | Fully sealed                                |
| Dust protection    | Requires gaskets | Hermetically encapsulated                   |
| Noise              | Audible click    | Silent                                      |
| Lifespan           | ~100k presses    | Practically unlimited                       |
| Design flexibility | Fixed            | Invisible, capacitive sensing through resin |

## Adaptive sensitivity

ZeroKeyUSB automatically calibrates the touch sensitivity during startup.\
This ensures stable performance across different environments — whether you’re using it in dry air, humid conditions, or even with light gloves.

The firmware dynamically adjusts thresholds to reject accidental touches from nearby objects or power noise.

---

## Minimal energy consumption

Despite scanning all channels continuously, the touch system consumes only a few microamps.\
This allows ZeroKeyUSB to remain **highly responsive** while staying **extremely power-efficient** — perfect for an always-ready USB device.

---

## Built to last

Because there are no mechanical parts, the touch interface contributes directly to the device’s lifespan and reliability.\
Even after years of use, the responsiveness remains identical to day one.

Combined with the waterproof encapsulation, this design ensures that **ZeroKeyUSB will continue to function flawlessly long after most electronic devices fail**.

<Note>
  The touch interface was designed for human interaction — it ignores static electricity, moisture, or random contact from objects.\
  Only intentional touches are recognized.
