# Mintlify Documentation Workspace

This repository is configured to work with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) and provides a minimal documentation site structure. All documentation content lives inside the `docs/` directory and is authored in MDX.

## Getting started

1. Install the Mintlify CLI (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install -g mintlify
   ```
2. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```
3. Build a production bundle:
   ```bash
   mintlify build
   ```

Refer to the pages under `docs/` to begin customizing your documentation experience.
