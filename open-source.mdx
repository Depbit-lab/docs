title: "Open Source & Transparency"
description: "How we publish the firmware, schematics, and build process so you can verify — not blindly trust — ZeroKeyUSB."

## Philosophy

ZeroKeyUSB is intentionally **offline and closed for modification**, yet **open for inspection**.
Publishing the full firmware and hardware documentation lets anyone audit the security model while keeping production devices sealed and tamper-resistant.

---

## Repository overview

All public materials live in the [Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb](https://github.com/Depbit-lab/zerokeyusb) repository.
You will find:

- `firmware/` → C++ source code for the SAMD21 application, including crypto helpers and device drivers.
- `hardware/` → Schematics, PCB layout, and BOM files for each hardware revision.
- `tests/` → Unit tests that validate AES routines, EEPROM transactions, and TOTP calculations.
- `docs/` → Markdown guides that mirror this knowledge base.

Each tagged release includes the signed firmware binary (`zerokeyusb-vX.Y.Z.bin`) and SHA-256 checksums for independent verification.

---

## Reproducible builds

We publish the exact toolchain configuration used at the factory:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/depbit-lab/zerokeyusb-toolchain:latest
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/project ghcr.io/depbit-lab/zerokeyusb-toolchain make release
```

- The container ships with ARM GCC, openocd, and all dependencies pinned.
- Running `make release` produces a firmware image identical to the official one (matching checksum).
- The build artifacts include a manifest with git commit, build timestamp, and compiler flags.

---

## Security-first contributions

We welcome issues and pull requests that improve documentation, testing, or tooling.
To keep the production firmware auditable:

1. Development happens on feature branches.
2. Every change requires two maintainer reviews focused on security impact.
3. CI runs unit tests and static analysis (cppcheck, clang-tidy) on each commit.
4. Release candidates undergo manual hardware testing before a new tag is created.

No unsigned firmware is ever flashed to customer devices.

---

## Verifying your device

You can confirm that your ZeroKeyUSB runs the officially signed firmware:

1. Check the firmware version from **Menu → Settings → About**.
2. Download the matching release binary from GitHub and compute its SHA-256 hash.
3. Compare it against the checksum printed in the release notes.
4. (Optional) If you have factory tools, you can read the flash memory and verify the signature block — the repository documents the process.

This transparency gives you confidence that what you audit is exactly what ships.

## Community channels

- **Issues** → Report bugs, propose features, or request clarifications.
- **Discussions** → Share tips, automation scripts, or talk about self-hosted backups.
- **Security inbox** → Email `security@zerokeyusb.com` for coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

We believe trust is earned. Open documentation and reproducible builds are our way to prove it.

<Note>
Open source does not mean modifiable firmware on retail units. The published code is for transparency, audits, and educational purposes.
