# Getting Started

Follow these steps to launch the documentation locally and deploy updates.

## 1. Install dependencies

Mintlify requires Node.js (version 16 or newer). Once Node is installed, add the Mintlify CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g mintlify
```

## 2. Run the development server

From the repository root, run:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The CLI serves your documentation at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically reloads as you edit files.

## 3. Build for production

When you are ready to publish, create a static build:

```bash
mintlify build
```

Deploy the contents of the generated `build` directory to your hosting provider.
