# Welcome to Your Mintlify Docs

Mintlify combines Markdown with React components to help you craft beautiful and interactive documentation experiences. This starter homepage highlights the most common elements you will customize.

## Highlights

- **Instant setup** with a predictable folder structure.
- **MDX authoring** that supports JSX components when you need richer interactivity.
- **Navigation defined in `mint.json`** so your sidebar always matches your content.

Get started by editing this page or adding new MDX files under the `docs/` directory.
