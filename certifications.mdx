## Built for global markets

ZeroKeyUSB is produced in facilities that follow **ISO 9001** (quality management) and **ISO 27001** (information security) standards.
Every production batch is traceable — from component sourcing to final encapsulation — ensuring consistent security and durability.

## Electrical compliance

| Standard | Scope | Status |
| -------- | ----- | ------ |
| **CE** (EN 55032 / EN 55035) | Electromagnetic compatibility for IT equipment. | ✅ Passed, report `EMC-ZKU-2024-CE`. |
| **FCC Part 15, Class B** | Radiated & conducted emissions for consumer devices. | ✅ Passed, report `EMC-ZKU-2024-FCC`. |
| **RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU** | Restriction of hazardous substances. | ✅ All components compliant. |
| **USB-IF Electrical** | USB 2.0 low/full-speed electrical tolerance. | ✅ Verified through third-party lab. |

These certifications guarantee that ZeroKeyUSB can be safely used in homes, offices, and regulated environments.

## Environmental robustness

ZeroKeyUSB undergoes stress tests to ensure the resin-encapsulated design survives daily wear:

- **Temperature cycling**: −10 °C to 60 °C, 40 cycles, no failures.
- **Humidity exposure**: 95% RH at 40 °C for 72 hours, no condensation ingress.
- **Salt fog**: 5% NaCl, 24 hours, zero corrosion on exposed contacts.
- **Water resistance**: Meets **IP54** splash protection once connected to USB-C cable.

## Data protection practices

While hardware cannot obtain formal “security certifications” without network interfaces, we adopt industry best practices:

- **Secure provisioning**: PIN signature, IV generation, and serial numbers are programmed during final testing on an isolated network.
- **Tamper-evident seals**: Each device ships with a unique holographic seal tied to the serial number.
- **Penetration testing**: Annual third-party audits review firmware, hardware, and supply-chain risks.

Audit summaries are available to enterprise customers under NDA.
